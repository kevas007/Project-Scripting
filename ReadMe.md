# Hello  welcome to my Script !

I built this script to help us to start some projects (Reactjs, vue3, React Native)

 To use it, it's simple to launch this command line in your terminal:
 - for window````powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File ./ScriptProjet.ps1````.
 -  for mac you install  ``brew``  after  you install  powershell for mac  you will use  ``brew install --cask powershell``. Now  you use this command ````pwsh -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File ./ScriptProjet.ps1````.
 Ps: (take the path from the root of your pc to where your script is located)

You have the possibility to launch 3 projects for the moment Reactjs, vue3  and ReactNative

- For Reactjs you will writte 'react'
- For  Vue 3 you will writte 'vue'
- For  ReactNative you will writte 'react-native'
