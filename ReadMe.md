## Hello  welcome to my Script

## I build this script to help us to start  some project (Reactjs, vue3, React Native)

####  To use it, it's simple to launch this command line in your terminal: 'powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File "c:\...\...\ScriptProjet.ps1"'. 
#### Ps: (take the path from the root of your pc to where your script is located)

###  You have the possibility to launch 3 projects for the moment Reactjs, vue3  and ReactNative

# For Reactjs you will writte 'react'

# For  Vue 2 you will writte 'vue'


# For  ReactNative you will writte 'react-native'



### Thanks for use  myScript Kevas007
